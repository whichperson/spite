# Spite

spite (definition): greek word for house, english word for the desire to hurt or annoy someone (landlords in this case)

# Why
I want to move away to a different city but who has time to check a bunch of websites every day in hopes of finding a shitty place? I'll just make the script do it.

# How
Python. 

# Can I?
Yes. You can do whatever you want. If you want to contribute, do it. If you want to use the script, read the instructions file.
